Authors:  Xiaoyue Zhao, Lin Zhang, and Dipankar Bandyopadhyay

Status:  "Under Review" in Sankhya-B

with non-random missingness. Application to real data

There are 3 files in the repository

(a) PDData.Rdata (a R data file with the motivating PD data loaded. Continuous covariates are standardized) 
(b) GEV_NR.R (Main R program) and 
(c) GEV_NR_U.R (R program to compute the Hamiltonian steps)

Steps: 

1. Put all 3 files in the same folder. 
2. Set your R working directory
3. Run "GEV_NR.R". This will load the .Rdata, and also call "GEV_NR_U"
